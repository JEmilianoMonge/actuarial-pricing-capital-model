# Actuarial Pricing & Capital Modeling Study

## Project Overview 
This project develops a pricing, reserving, and solvency capital framework for a portfolio of 2,000 whole life insurance policies under life-table mortality and a 6% interest assumption.
The analysis integrates actuarial present value techniques, aggregate loss modeling, prospective reserving, and confidence-level capital estimation.

	•	Premium adequacy under the equivalence principle
	•	Portfolio-level underwriting risk
	•	Reserve development at duration 20
	•	Required capital buffer for 98% solvency confidence


## Methodology
	•	Net single and annual premium calculations
	•	Second-moment variance derivation for present value of claims
	•	Central Limit Theorem approximation for aggregate portfolio loss
	•	Prospective reserve calculation using actuarial present value methods
	•	Confidence-based capital requirement estimation


## Key Results
	•	Net Single Premium: $154.93
	•	Net Annual Premium: $10.38
	•	Risk-Adjusted Premium (2.5% probability of loss): $161.42
	•	20-Year Aggregate Reserve: $423,076
	•	Capital Requirement (98% confidence): $838.62
